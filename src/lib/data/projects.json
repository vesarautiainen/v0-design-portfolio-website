For this project the main requirements were: \n\n• Full convergence: the same switcher would need to work on phone, tablet and PC desktop. \n• Needs to handle both windowed and non-windowed environments. \n• Multiple workspace support needs to be taken into account. \n• Needs to support all available input types: touch, pointer and keyboard. \n• Single code base approach (stakeholder and engineering requirement). \n• The existing design relying on stacked cards needs to be taken into consideration. \n\n The main UX challenges:\n • How to create an adapting layout that transforms andcovers all use cases.\n • Creating consistent set of transitions and animations which would also be delightful to use and reinforce user’s metal model of the system.\n • Application window size can be arbitrary and vary between the windows simultaneously on the screen.\n • Horizontal space is limited but the design needs to scale to support 0-N application and 0-N workspaces."

The prototype also worked as partial documentation for developers."
